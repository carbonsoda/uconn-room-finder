### UConn Room Finder

This is meant to find which classrooms are occupied so students can find an empty one to study in (M-F). The room-availabilities are publicly available through the [UCONN Registrar's schedule snapshots (updated nightly)](https://scheduling.uconn.edu/class-schedule-snapshots/). 

At the moment it outputs an `.xlsx` file that shows which rooms are occupied. The output still needs to be cleaned up.

Ultimately, the point of this is to build a website where students can filter out the room availabilities by building and days of the week. Of course, this can't account for scheduled faculty & club meetings or events.
